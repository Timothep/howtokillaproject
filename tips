Stay always busy, and never fail to come up with a new excuse why you weren't able to do anything to contribute to the project.  | Kerstin Gronauer | @kanbankerstin

Have a lot of meetings with nearly everyone in your company. It's important to keep all those guys updated on the project all the time, which shouldn't be too hard cause you have no time to work anyway (because you have to schedule and hold meetings all the time). | Kerstin Gronauer | @kanbankerstin
Always come to work when you have a cold or the flu. Your colleagues will love you for it because now they can get their revenge by infecting every other healthy person in the team. If this act is executed skillfully you get a perfect circle.  | Kerstin Gronauer | @kanbankerstin
Never go to any team meetings your team schedules. You don't need to know what they talk about anyway because they are all a bunch of losers. | Kerstin Gronauer | @kanbankerstin
If you are a PO, your user stories need to be INFEST! Inexpressive, non-negotiable, fat, egocentric, super detailed and technical. | Kerstin Gronauer | @kanbankerstin
